# SAM-Data

This repository serves as a archives of SAM files from several sources for use in OG models.  It exists to allow users of models using the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) framework to access the data in a consistent way in case online sources are down or have changed.

All data is stored in the `Data` directory in the repository, with subdirectories by country, identifed with the three letter country code.  The data is stored in their original format.
